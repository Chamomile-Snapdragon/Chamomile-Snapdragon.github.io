        <h2>Softmore in Greenville, South Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a Softmore at Bob Jones University studying Visual studies with a minor in Cinema Production. I work for Bob Jones Academy at the Child Development Center as often as I can.</p>
         <p>
            I enjoy things like stories and art, some of my hobbies include drawing, writting, sewing, taking care of fish and making herbal tea. &amp; I really would like this page to be about my passion for tea and how to grow, harvest, and brew herbs but due to time I won't be able to do so right now.
         </p> 
         <p>
            I also enjoy martial arts as well as collecting graphic novels for a small home lybrary, Idealy by a sunny window to enjoy with some fresh tea.
